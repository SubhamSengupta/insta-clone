# Guidelines to run the app

## requirements

- Node-8 for best peroformance
- npm (optional)

1. Go to the extracted folder from terminal
2. run `npm i` to install the dependencies
3. run `npm run start`
4. The app should be running in your browser

Documentation: Good code should be self-documented, I tried to write variable names, function and classes names as self-explanatory as possible. Time was a big factor so did not use extra tools, or extra libraries (did not use Redux too). I was having a problem with the api and getting a CORS error, `mode: 'no-cors'` did not work too, made a way around for the response.
Screenshots are attached.

Thanks
